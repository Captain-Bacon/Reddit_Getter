The missiles varied slightly in azimuth compared to my line of flight in their climb, but all corrected in azimuth to an accurate dead stern position during push over and dive phase. (Missile altitude] estimated 90,000ft is probably quite close, but could vary a few thousand feet either way.”\n\nDescription by an A-12 pilot from a mission in October 1967. The A-12 flew higher than the SR-71 so the altitude alone was not protection. Some damage did occur on one mission. Text from the book “Lockheed Blackbird: Beyond the Secret Missions” by Paul F. Crickmore.",

A long mission would be eight or more. Through the whole history of the programme, through 22 years, we had 13 sorties that were over 11 hours; very, very long missions. But they were very rare.\n>\n>\"Twelve of those missions were flown out of the East Coast of the United States during the Yom Kippur War in 1973, and we flew to the Middle East and all the way back to the East Coast, and the product was given straight to the President. The President wanted to find out whether the Arabs and the Israelis had really moved back from the front line like they said they did. We went over there, took the imagery, came back and showed photographic proof they were both lying about where their forces were. He called both countries and said, 'Get them back, I've got proof you're not where you're supposed to be.' That’s what ended the Yom Kippur War.\"",

Right in front of the engines was a temperature probe. When that temperature was around 427C (800F) that's as fast as we were allowed to go. The makers of the engine - Pratt & Whitney - would not warranty or guarantee anything beyond 427. After that all bets were off, the engine could come unglued or you could shed turbine blades.\"",

On paper, the blackbird was M0.3 faster, in practice, they weren't even in the same league. It's like comparing a drag car to an F1 car... Sure they might reach similar speeds, but one does it for a very short stint, the other does it for hours.\n\nWithin safe operating envelopes, the MiG was over Mach 1 slower, and within mission envelopes, it was over Mach 2 slower, if it could even complete the mission duration the blackbird could.\n\nNot fanboying the blackbird or anything cause they're both incredible aircraft, but they really aren't comparable.",

[Russia was it’s own entity in the same way that Ukraine and Estonia were.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic) It appears to me that the fact that Russia existed independent of the Soviet union probably helped them transition into the post-Soviet era relatively peacefully.\n\n>On 8 December 1991, the heads of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus signed the Belavezha Accords. The agreement declared dissolution of the USSR by its original founding states (i.e., renunciation of the 1922 Treaty on the Creation of the USSR) and established the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) as a loose confederation. On 12 December, the agreement was ratified by the Supreme Soviet (the parliament of Russian SFSR); therefore the Russian SFSR had renounced the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR and de facto declared Russia's independence from the USSR itself and the ties with the other Soviet Socialist Republics.\n\n>On 25 December 1991, following the resignation of Gorbachev as President of the Soviet Union (and former General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union), the Russian SFSR was renamed the Russian Federation.",

Baffled at what aircraft could be keeping up with them, the Blackbird pilots make the course change and eventually see a Concorde sliding by them. That would have been an interesting dichotomy: two military pilots in pressure suits looking at civilian passengers in a shirt-sleeve environment, probably tucking into their canapés, at nearly their altitude and speed.",

In the early 60s no computers existed that could render or even come close to computing how this aircraft should be built. It was all done on drawing boards with pencils, rulers and protractors (if you remember what any of these are.) That’s one incredible feat if you think about it.\n\nanother article\n\n>Not long after the SR-71 took to the sky, the most difficult mathematical aspects of aircraft design were handed off to computers that could crunch the numbers more quickly and reliably — but that wasn’t the case for the Blackbird. Kelly Johnson and his team used their “slide rules,” which were basically just specialized rulers with a slide that designers could use to aid them in their calculations in designing the mighty Blackbird. Years later, the aircraft was reviewed using modern aviation design computers only to reveal that the machines would not have suggested any changes to the design.",

You know, that ring of vapor that you see around jets going supersonic at air shows. So, behind that cone the air is straight up not moving. So, at speeds above Mach 1, how do you get air into the engine? Easy, says they 1960 engineers, just design a moving pointy spike on the front of the engine that creates a Mach cone that has the outside of the cone contacting the inside of the engine cowling, thus allowing air into the engine.\n\nNext problem, as you go faster, the angle of the Mach cone gets shallower. So, as the vehicle goes faster and faster, the cone needs to move (don't quote me here I'm remembering from an aeronautics class I took years ago) farther out and slightly angled downwards to keep the cone in the proper location to let air into the engine. \n\nThen there's all sorts of extra ports and vents in the cowling that open and close at different speeds and everything, I don't remember. Just know that some engineers made it all work and it's absolutely insane that it worked at all... And it was origonal going to be pink XD",

Because of the lag in repositioning the spike, yaw would cause an unstart that was violent enough to bang a helmet against the canopy. I think the one thing about it that surprised me the most is— it’s not that big. Tiny cockpits. The pilots who flew those long missions were exceptional humans.",

Nearly all supersonic fighters in the US inventory use some variation of this arrangement.  \n\nNote, however, that variable geometry intakes are not required just to reach supersonic speed; it's only as your speed increases that you reach a point where you need to increase the efficiency of the engine inlet to be able to reach even higher speeds. \n\nOn older, slower supersonic jets from the 1960's, you will often see a fixed spike mounted in the engine inlet.  [(e.g. the F-104)](https://b-domke.de/AviationImages/Starfighter/5953.html)  \n\nAs others have already posted, the movable inlet spike on the SR-71's inlet was largely responsible for the high propulsion efficiency (84%) of the engine system.  Ben Rich, designer of the inlet, stated it thusly: \"The inlets produced 64% of the airplane's full-throttled power.\" \n\nFor more information about this amazing plane, I recommend reading \"Skunk Works\", by Ben Rich.

Aircraft is flying supersonic, but you have to slow the air to subsonic speeds while preventing a high pressure shockwave that would block the the inlet, all while maintaining a higher pressure then the combustion chamber and keeping the airflow and combustion moving rearward toward the exhaust to prevent compressor stall and \"back fire\".\n\nAll the while being able to keep a flame burning at any speed and thrust setting. Really bad day in THE Blackbird to have flameout out on a high speed pass.\n\nEdit: I have had the good fortune of flying with some past Blackbird pilots in my daily job (civilian).

            "body": "That it was only ever successfully intercepted once, and it was done by the Swedes because they were annoyed we kept bumping their airspace.\n\nThe longer version:\n\nBack when they were doing flights looking at St. Petersburg they would have to come in through a very narrow section of international airspace and exit in the same one. With the huge turning circle of the aircraft, it meant that the route was very specific, and therefore predicable. Unfortunately it also meant trespassing over Swedish airspace just a tad. They reached out through diplomatic channels but were pretty much told to get over it.\n\nSo the Swedish Air Force decided they'd prove a point. If they could track when the Blackbird entered that sliver of airspace they could track and accurately predict where it would be on its route all the way to its exit. And after several more flyovers they did.\n\nSo the Blackbird comes through right on time, and the pilot selected scrambles and gets in the air with his JA-37. He flies a pre-planned intercept course, directed to the second by ground controllers, and climbs right when they tell him to. The climb puts him right at the edge of a stall, and the window when he can actually lock the Blackbird with an effective firing solution is only a dozen or so seconds long, but he manages to do it! Reportedly, the Blackbird pilot and back seater were so shocked at seeing an RWR lock warning that they forgot to turn on their jammer.\n\nSweden then kindly (and probably with a big shit-eating grin) told the US not to trespass their airspace anymore and the route was adjusted just enough to avoid Sweden's airspace.\n\nSo yeah, them crazy Swedes, man.\n\nTangentially related, but see also the Swedish sub that snuck through an entire US Carrier Battle Group, got within torpedo range, took a picture through their periscope and mailed it to the Admiral of said fleet.",

The feeling we associate with asphyxiation is caused by carbon dioxide buildup, not our bodies detecting the lack of oxygen. Asphyxiation by nitrogen has been proposed as a means of \"humane\" execution - ideally, you just go to \"sleep.\" Before the first space shuttle launch, 3 workers died when they accidentally went into an area that was nitrogen-purged (the first article was written after the first one died; two died later of complications).\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/20/us/shuttle-passes-test-a-worker-is-killed.html](https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/20/us/shuttle-passes-test-a-worker-is-killed.html)\n\n[https://www.space.com/11120-nasa-shuttle-worker-accident.html](https://www.space.com/11120-nasa-shuttle-worker-accident.html)\n\nWalking into an argon purge in a (properly functioning) \"spacesuit\" is no more dangerous than going into a similarly nitrogen-purged area. In fact, the argon, being heavier molecularly than air, disperses more readily if it isn't in an area where it can \"pool.\" Also, nitrogen is not suitable as a purge for arc welding; while it is unreactive in most situations, it can react in the presence of an electrical arc, so a weld may still end up being contaminated.\n\nhttp://blog.parker.com/argon-or-nitrogen-which-is-best-for-your-application#:\\~:text=There%20are%20two%20instances%20where,nitrogen%20is%20the%20better%20choice.",

            "body": "My favorite is that the ultimate mission range was limited only by the onboard capacity for Triethylborane. While it was the perfect fuel for the engines JP-7 had some very problematic challenges associated with it, namely its notoriously poor volatility. This make the engines a pain to start and caused big issues with the afterburners due to ignitor fouling. You see, on most jets there is (essentially) a spark plug which helps to ignite the raw fuel which is being poured into the engine at startup. However, because JP-7 was so inflammable it wouldn't ignite reliably, and because of the relatively low availability of air (particularly at altitude) the fuel would experience incomplete combusion which would gum up and foul traditional ignitors. Enter Triethylborane (TEB): a pyrophoric liquid which auto-ignites in air and produces an extremely hot, apple-green flame. Lockheed engineers designed a system which stored a small volume (about 21 oz) of TEB, and whenever the afterburner was lit a small dose of the liquid would be injected into the exhaust to ensure that the fuel ignited properly. This produced a very unique green flash whenever the engine was started or the afterburner was lit. TEB also caused some problems too, because it is pretty scary stuff to handle since it will auto-ignite with a lot of energy. There wasn't a feasible way to refill the system while the plane was airborne, so ultimately you could only stay airborne while you had at least 1 shot of TEB remaining (because it was critical if you needed to outrun a missile or restart an engine). So, the way this was managed was a dial labeled \"TEB\" right next to the throttle levers; when the system was charged the dial would be set to 16 and when the engines were started the dial would tick down to 15. From then on, each time the throttle was moved from mil power into the afterburner range the TEB would dispense and kick off the fuel with a bright green flare. This could cause even more issues for pilots during refueling, since the plane had trouble maintaining lift at low speeds with a near-full fuel load, so it was a fine art for pilots to be able to modulate the throttle to provide enough thrust from the afterburner on one engine to maintain lift while still keeping the aircraft on course while so heavily laden with fuel. Anyway, once you were out of TEB the pilots had to return to base because otherwise they would have no way to restart the engines, and they really didn't want to have to make an unscheduled stop at an airport where they could be seen by prying eyes.",

The farther back over the cone the air moves, the more speed it bleeds off. As the slowed, but still supersonic, air continues to move farther into the inlet, the normal shock wave springs up between the inlet throat and the engine compressor—exactly where it is supposed to be. Once there, the normal shock wave slows the air passing through it to subsonic speeds, preparing it to enter the compressor.",

This isn't an issue on landing, because they touch down at lower speeds. I also would think the Blackbird would aerobrake on landing. You can see an F-16 doing that here: https://images.app.goo.gl/Yg1bY5hywb5o8Yqu8\n\nThe pilot keeps the nose up speed drops below about 100mph. Similarly it looks the SR-71 may perform the same maneuver on landing:\nhttps://images.app.goo.gl/3aQusYCnUKhQE7vP6",

            "body": "**SR-71 pilots had to fly sideways while refueling mid-air.**\n\nThe Blackbird was a thirsty airplane. They burned so much fuel because they almost constantly flew in full afterburner to achieve their (unclassified) top speed of Mach 3.2. But eventually, that fuel would run out and they’d have to regroup with a KC-135 to take on some more. During an average tanking operation, they’d be plugged in for 15 minutes or even longer, and receive more than 70,000 pounds of fuel. Near the end of each refuel op, the engines at military power (maximum throttle before igniting afterburner) couldn’t provide sufficient thrust. The drastically altered center of gravity from the new fuel and weak thrust resulted in pilots struggling to stay on the refueling boom. They needed a solution to this problem and eventually found one:\n\n **Light the afterburner on one engine.**\n\n With one engine in minimum afterburner, this produced asymmetric yaw, so the plane flew partially to the opposite direction while still hooked onto the refueling probe. The pilots would have to look out their quarter windows in order to fly straight with the tanker. They typically preferred using the left engine’s afterburner because only the left quarter windows were capable of being defogged. \n\nAs you could imagine, flying this plane took incredible skill. The pilots were essentially wearing spacesuits because they flew at extremely high altitudes of 70-80,000 feet. The heavy suits and shoes would sometimes restrict their movements and affected control inputs. Combine that with fatigue from flying on long missions that could sometimes last over eight hours, the stress of being shot down over hostile territories, and a bruised ego from your RSO (Reconnaissance Systems Officer, the guy in the back seat) criticizing your aerial refueling attempts, it truly separated the best from the rest. \n\nAnd all these quirks are why I love this plane so much. I highly recommend reading stories from Brian Shul and other pilots! You won’t be disappointed!",

                            "body": "Found it in some other comments: \"As a former SR-71 pilot, and a professional keynote speaker, the question I'm most often asked is \"How fast would that SR-71 fly?\" I can be assured of hearing that question several times at any event I attend. It's an interesting question, given the aircraft's proclivity for speed, but there really isn't one number to give, as the jet would always give you a little more speed if you wanted it to. It was common to see 35 miles a minute. Because we flew a programmed Mach number on most missions, and never wanted to harm the plane in any way, we never let it run out to any limits of temperature or speed. Thus, each SR-71 pilot had his own individual “high” speed that he saw at some point on some mission. I saw mine over Libya when Khadafy fired two missiles my way, and max power was in order. Let’s just say that the plane truly loved speed and effortlessly took us to Mach numbers we hadn’t previously seen. So it was with great surprise, when at the end of one of my presentations, someone asked, “what was the slowest you ever flew the Blackbird?” This was a first. After giving it some thought, I was reminded of a story that I had never shared before, and relayed the following. I was flying the SR-71 out of RAF Mildenhall, England , with my back-seater, Walt Watson; we were returning from a mission over Europe and the Iron Curtain when we received a radio transmission from home base. As we scooted across Denmark in three minutes, we learned that a small RAF base in the English countryside had requested an SR-71 fly-past. The air cadet commander there was a former Blackbird pilot, and thought it would be a motivating moment for the young lads to see the mighty SR-71 perform a low approach. No problem, we were happy to do it. After a quick aerial refueling over the North Sea , we proceeded to find the small airfield. Walter had a myriad of sophisticated navigation equipment in the back seat, and began to vector me toward the field. Descending to subsonic speeds, we found ourselves over a densely wooded area in a slight haze. Like most former WWII British airfields, the one we were looking for had a small tower and little surrounding infrastructure. Walter told me we were close and that I should be able to see the field, but I saw nothing. Nothing but trees as far as I could see in the haze. We got a little lower, and I pulled the throttles back from 325 knots we were at. With the gear up, anything under 275 was just uncomfortable. Walt said we were practically over the field—yet; there was nothing in my windscreen. I banked the jet and started a gentle circling maneuver in hopes of picking up anything that looked like a field. Meanwhile, below, the cadet commander had taken the cadets up on the catwalk of the tower in order to get a prime view of the fly-past. It was a quiet, still day with no wind and partial gray overcast. Walter continued to give me indications that the field should be below us but in the overcast and haze, I couldn't see it.. The longer we continued to peer out the window and circle, the slower we got. With our power back, the awaiting cadets heard nothing. I must have had good instructors in my flying career, as something told me I better cross-check the gauges. As I noticed the airspeed indicator slide below 160 knots, my heart stopped and my adrenalin-filled left hand pushed two throttles full forward. At this point we weren't really flying, but were falling in a slight bank. Just at the moment that both afterburners lit with a thunderous roar of flame (and what a joyous feeling that was) the aircraft fell into full view of the shocked observers on the tower. Shattering the still quiet of that morning, they now had 107 feet of fire-breathing titanium in their face as the plane leveled and accelerated, in full burner, on the tower side of the infield, closer than expected, maintaining what could only be described as some sort of ultimate knife-edge pass. Quickly reaching the field boundary, we proceeded back to Mildenhall without incident. We didn't say a word for those next 14 minutes. After landing, our commander greeted us, and we were both certain he was reaching for our wings. Instead, he heartily shook our hands and said the commander had told him it was the greatest SR-71 fly-past he had ever seen, especially how we had surprised them with such a precise maneuver that could only be described as breathtaking. He said that some of the cadet’s hats were blown off and the sight of the plan form of the plane in full afterburner dropping right in front of them was unbelievable. Walt and I both understood the concept of “breathtaking” very well that morning, and sheepishly replied that they were just excited to see our low approach. As we retired to the equipment room to change from space suits to flight suits, we just sat there-we hadn't spoken a word since “the pass.” Finally, Walter looked at me and said, “One hundred fifty-six knots. What did you see?” Trying to find my voice, I stammered, “One hundred fifty-two.” We sat in silence for a moment. Then Walt said, “Don’t ever do that to me again!” And I never did. A year later, Walter and I were having lunch in the Mildenhall Officer’s club, and overheard an officer talking to some cadets about an SR-71 fly-past that he had seen one day. Of course, by now the story included kids falling off the tower and screaming as the heat of the jet singed their eyebrows. Noticing our HABU patches, as we stood there with lunch trays in our hands, he asked us to verify to the cadets that such a thing had occurred. Walt just shook his head and said, “It was probably just a routine low approach; they're pretty impressive in that plane.” Impressive indeed. Little did I realize after relaying this experience to my audience that day that it would become one of the most popular and most requested stories. It’s ironic that people are interested in how slow the world’s fastest jet can fly. Regardless of your speed, however, it’s always a good idea to keep that cross-check up…and keep your Mach up, too.\"",

                            "body": "Found it in some other comments: \"As a former SR-71 pilot, and a professional keynote speaker, the question I'm most often asked is \"How fast would that SR-71 fly?\" I can be assured of hearing that question several times at any event I attend. It's an interesting question, given the aircraft's proclivity for speed, but there really isn't one number to give, as the jet would always give you a little more speed if you wanted it to. It was common to see 35 miles a minute. Because we flew a programmed Mach number on most missions, and never wanted to harm the plane in any way, we never let it run out to any limits of temperature or speed. Thus, each SR-71 pilot had his own individual “high” speed that he saw at some point on some mission. I saw mine over Libya when Khadafy fired two missiles my way, and max power was in order. Let’s just say that the plane truly loved speed and effortlessly took us to Mach numbers we hadn’t previously seen. So it was with great surprise, when at the end of one of my presentations, someone asked, “what was the slowest you ever flew the Blackbird?” This was a first. After giving it some thought, I was reminded of a story that I had never shared before, and relayed the following. I was flying the SR-71 out of RAF Mildenhall, England , with my back-seater, Walt Watson; we were returning from a mission over Europe and the Iron Curtain when we received a radio transmission from home base. As we scooted across Denmark in three minutes, we learned that a small RAF base in the English countryside had requested an SR-71 fly-past. The air cadet commander there was a former Blackbird pilot, and thought it would be a motivating moment for the young lads to see the mighty SR-71 perform a low approach. No problem, we were happy to do it. After a quick aerial refueling over the North Sea , we proceeded to find the small airfield. Walter had a myriad of sophisticated navigation equipment in the back seat, and began to vector me toward the field. Descending to subsonic speeds, we found ourselves over a densely wooded area in a slight haze. Like most former WWII British airfields, the one we were looking for had a small tower and little surrounding infrastructure. Walter told me we were close and that I should be able to see the field, but I saw nothing. Nothing but trees as far as I could see in the haze. We got a little lower, and I pulled the throttles back from 325 knots we were at. With the gear up, anything under 275 was just uncomfortable. Walt said we were practically over the field—yet; there was nothing in my windscreen. I banked the jet and started a gentle circling maneuver in hopes of picking up anything that looked like a field. Meanwhile, below, the cadet commander had taken the cadets up on the catwalk of the tower in order to get a prime view of the fly-past. It was a quiet, still day with no wind and partial gray overcast. Walter continued to give me indications that the field should be below us but in the overcast and haze, I couldn't see it.. The longer we continued to peer out the window and circle, the slower we got. With our power back, the awaiting cadets heard nothing. I must have had good instructors in my flying career, as something told me I better cross-check the gauges. As I noticed the airspeed indicator slide below 160 knots, my heart stopped and my adrenalin-filled left hand pushed two throttles full forward. At this point we weren't really flying, but were falling in a slight bank. Just at the moment that both afterburners lit with a thunderous roar of flame (and what a joyous feeling that was) the aircraft fell into full view of the shocked observers on the tower. Shattering the still quiet of that morning, they now had 107 feet of fire-breathing titanium in their face as the plane leveled and accelerated, in full burner, on the tower side of the infield, closer than expected, maintaining what could only be described as some sort of ultimate knife-edge pass. Quickly reaching the field boundary, we proceeded back to Mildenhall without incident. We didn't say a word for those next 14 minutes. After landing, our commander greeted us, and we were both certain he was reaching for our wings. Instead, he heartily shook our hands and said the commander had told him it was the greatest SR-71 fly-past he had ever seen, especially how we had surprised them with such a precise maneuver that could only be described as breathtaking. He said that some of the cadet’s hats were blown off and the sight of the plan form of the plane in full afterburner dropping right in front of them was unbelievable. Walt and I both understood the concept of “breathtaking” very well that morning, and sheepishly replied that they were just excited to see our low approach. As we retired to the equipment room to change from space suits to flight suits, we just sat there-we hadn't spoken a word since “the pass.” Finally, Walter looked at me and said, “One hundred fifty-six knots. What did you see?” Trying to find my voice, I stammered, “One hundred fifty-two.” We sat in silence for a moment. Then Walt said, “Don’t ever do that to me again!” And I never did. A year later, Walter and I were having lunch in the Mildenhall Officer’s club, and overheard an officer talking to some cadets about an SR-71 fly-past that he had seen one day. Of course, by now the story included kids falling off the tower and screaming as the heat of the jet singed their eyebrows. Noticing our HABU patches, as we stood there with lunch trays in our hands, he asked us to verify to the cadets that such a thing had occurred. Walt just shook his head and said, “It was probably just a routine low approach; they're pretty impressive in that plane.” Impressive indeed. Little did I realize after relaying this experience to my audience that day that it would become one of the most popular and most requested stories. It’s ironic that people are interested in how slow the world’s fastest jet can fly. Regardless of your speed, however, it’s always a good idea to keep that cross-check up…and keep your Mach up, too.\"",

It was at that precise moment I realized Walt and I had become a real crew, for we were both thinking in unison.\n‘Center, Aspen 20, you got a ground speed readout for us?’\nThere was a longer than normal pause … ‘Aspen, I show 1,942 knots.’\nNo further inquiries were heard on that frequency.”",
