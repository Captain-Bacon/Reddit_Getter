# Contributing to Reddit Content Extractor

Hello! Thanks so much for checking out this project and for considering contributing.

This is one of my first forays into sharing a project publicly, and I'm very much learning as I go, especially when it comes to managing contributions from others!

## How You Can Help

I'm open to all sorts of help, whether it's:

* Pointing out something that's broken (a bug!).
* Suggesting a new feature or an improvement to an existing one.
* Helping to improve the documentation (like this file!).
* Even offering to write some code.

## A Few Honest Caveats from Me (the Owner)

* **I'm still learning:** I'm not a professional developer, so my ability to quickly address complex issues or integrate sophisticated pull requests might be limited. I appreciate your patience and understanding!
* **Guidance welcome:** If you do submit a pull request or a detailed bug report, you might need to walk me through some aspects of it, especially if it involves more advanced Git/GitHub workflows or complex code changes. I'm eager to learn, though!
* **Time and Motivation:** This is a personal project, so my time and focus on it can vary. I'll do my best, but I can't promise immediate responses or fixes for everything.

## Getting Started with Contributions

If you'd like to contribute, here are some general pointers:

* **Bugs:** If you find something not working, letting me know is super helpful. If you can, please tell me:
  * What you were trying to do.
  * The Reddit URL involved (if any).
  * Any error messages you saw.
  * Don't worry too much about checking if it's "already reported" â€“ any information is good information at this stage.

* **Suggestions/Features:** If you have an idea, feel free to share it! Explaining what it is and why you think it would be cool is a great start.

* **Code Changes (Pull Requests):**
  * If you're thinking of making code changes, it might be a good idea to briefly discuss it first (e.g., by opening an "issue" on GitHub if the repository has them enabled, or just by reaching out if you know how). This helps make sure we're on the same page.
  * As mentioned, I'm still getting the hang of managing PRs, so clear explanations of what your changes do and why they're useful would be fantastic.

The best way to get in touch about contributions would likely be by opening an "Issue" on the GitHub repository page (if that feature is enabled for the public repo).

Thanks again for your interest!
