# This token will be automatically obtained and displayed in the console
# during the first successful run of the script (auth.py or the main script).
# After the first run, copy the REDDIT_REFRESH_TOKEN printed in the console
# and paste it here for subsequent non-interactive runs.
# Example (after first run): REDDIT_REFRESH_TOKEN="actual_refresh_token_value_here"

# Note: REDDIT_USERNAME and REDDIT_PASSWORD are not used by this script
# as it relies on OAuth 2.0 for authentication.
